##Why IntegralSTOR?
Over the past decade, open source storage components have evolved to provide almost all, if not more functionality as highly priced proprietary storage systems. [Fractalio Data](http://fractalio.com) bootstrapped IntegralSTOR to bring all these components together as an open source initiative on the Linux platform.

## What is IntegralSTOR?
IntegralSTOR is the single node (non-scaleout) flavor of the IntegralStor range of linux based unified storage systems. It is currently based on CentOS and uses ZFS on Linux as its on disk filesystem for user data. Its rich functionality makes it easy to use for primary storage or backup functionalities. An easy to use web based interface for administration allows you to easily setup and manage many advanced storage functionalities. Reporting, alerting and auditing are build in! It provides both file (NAS) and block storage along with other access protocols.

##What constitutes IntegralSTOR?
The open source world already provides the best components for most functionalities. However, while they may all work well by themselves, it usually requires time and effort to get them to work optimally and to work with each other. By integrating these solid underlying open source components under a single intuitive administrative unit, IntegralSTOR makes it easy to setup a high performance storage system. 

##Should I be using it?
If you are paying ridiculously high cost for reliable, high performance storage but do not have the time to put it together yourself using open source components, then IntegralSTOR is for you. Given that the underlying components power much of the Internet infrastructure already, you will get a rock solid storage system.

#How do I get help?
The community is always there to provide you with help in case you need it. However, if you would like dedicated support, Fractalio Data, who initiated the project can give you that for a small fee.

##Interested in helping out?
Your help in making IntegralSTOR the go-to storage system of choice for anybody, is most welcome. You can contribute in many ways and you do not need to be a hacker to help! The ["Contributing"](contributing.md)  section explains more on how to contribute.
